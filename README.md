# Statistical Learning (Predictive Modeling) in R

## Data

We'll be using the [Online News Popularity Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity) and the [clickstream data for online shopping Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/clickstream+data+for+online+shopping) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Since they have a quite large number of observations to run models during the sessions, we'll take subsamples of them, as indicated in the lecture notes.
