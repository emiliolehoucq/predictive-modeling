# Question

Fit boosted trees and random forests through a validation set approach to predict `order` in the [clickstream data for online shopping Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/clickstream+data+for+online+shopping). Which model fits the data best? Use a validation set approach. Also, visualize the importance of predictors for each model and the marginal relation between the most important predictor and the response for the random forest.
