# Question

Fit a single-layered neural network through 2 repeats of 3-fold cross validation to predict `order` in the [clickstream data for online shopping Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/clickstream+data+for+online+shopping). Which model fits the data best? Use a validation set approach. Also, visualize the marginal relation between `day` and the response with an ALE plot.
